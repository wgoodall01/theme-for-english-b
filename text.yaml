# Theme for English B
# Langston Hughes

- - "The instructor said":
      - The poem starts out with an 'instructor:' initially, it's externally motivated.
      - The speaker isn't writing this because they want to themselves; they're writing it because they have to.

        The structure of *Theme for English B* is laid out in three parts: the header, starting here, the page, and a brief, one-line conclusion. This allows Hughes to wrap his assignment in the context of where, when, and by whom it was written.

- kind: stanza
  blockquote: true
  children:
    - "Go home and write":
        - The professor's voice, in this section, clearly stands out from the rest of the poem.
        - As the only section of the poem which rhymes, it seems slightly shallow---like the professor doesn't really know the depth of the question they're asking.
        - |
          This line also raises the question: what does home really look like for the students of this class? As Hughes elaborates on later in the poem, the meaning of home is different for everyone.
    - "a page tonight."
    - "And let that page come out of you—"
    - "Then, it will be true.":
        - |
          This line really leaves us with a question: if you write from the heart, will your writing necessarily be true?
        - What does it really take to get to your own emotional truth?
        - These questions set the tone for the rest of the poem, as the speaker tries to get at the truth through their own personal experience.

- - "I wonder if it’s that simple?":
      - At this point, the speaker starts writing in first person, personally entering the poem.
      - In 1951 New York, Hughes's existence as an intellectual force is in and of itself a political statement.
      - The poem starts out by arguing we should realize that things that look simple---
        just 'letting \[the page\] be true'---can turn out to be incredibly challenging when contextualized.

  - "I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.":
      - |
        Twenty-two is the age when a student would graduate from college: a major watershed moment where they have to move from completing their education to pursuing a career.
      - |
        Langston Hughes wasn't actually born in Winston-Salem (he was born in [Joplin, Missouri](https://www.biography.com/writer/langston-hughes)). This tells us that the poem isn't strictly autobiographical: Hughes and the speaker are two separate people.

  - "I went to school there, then Durham, then here":
      - The speaker values their education---enough to stick with it through multiple moves and changes.

  - "to this college on the hill above Harlem.":
      - Most likely, this is referring to City College, literally [located on a hill](https://earth.google.com/web/@40.81680112,-73.94992514,50.82805981a,775.42600941d,35y,-16.61960919h,61.36881103t,0r) above the city. This is, again, another hint that the speaker is not Hughes---as Hughes studied at the nearby Columbia University.

  - "I am the only colored student in my class.":
      - Here, the speaker starts explicitly talking about race, and its presence in their life.

  - "The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,"
  - "through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,"
  - "Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,"
  - "the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator":
      - The Harlem Branch YMCA---originally constructed due to the YMCA's [official policy of racial segregation](https://www.lib.umn.edu/ymca/guide-afam-history) from its founding in 1851 up until 1946---was a major cultural hub in the Harlem Renaissance. The lower floors contained a fitness center, while the upper floors were apartments.
      - Claude McKay, another leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance, lived in the Y. In 1976, it was [officially designated a US National Historic Landmark](https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NHLS/76002143_text) for this reason.
  - "up to my room, sit down, and write this page:":
      - By this point, Hughes has established the setting. The narrator is a student very similar to Hughes. They both live and study in Harlem. They both struggle with finding their own true identity. They both use writing as a tool to help elicit the truth.
      - This setting is the speaker's home. Through the beginning of the poem, they follow the instructor's directions literally---going home to write a page.

- - "It’s not easy to know what is true for you or me":
      - The theme of discovering the truth follows the speaker from their life into their writing.
      - At this point, the speaker is using writing to discover what their truth really is.
  - "at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I’m what":
      - Here the speaker comments on the influence of his age on truth. What does this formative stage in life lead them to believe?
      - It is harder to know what's true in the world around you, when you're still working out what's true about yourself.

  - "I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you.":
      - The speaker acknowledges that truth can only extend to the outputs of our senses. Again, it's externally motivated---the speaker tries to extract the truth from his environment.
  - "hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.":
      - In this rhythmic line, the speaker starts talking to Harlem itself.

  - "(I hear New York, too.) Me—who?":
      - After the parenthetical, the speaker quickly questions who they are---their self-identity. It is the same concept as before, an attempt to derive the truth.

- - "Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.":
      - The stanza starts out with description. It goes to show some common ground with the instructor---that there are a set of core, universal joys of life.
  - "I like to work, read, learn, and understand life."

  - "I like a pipe for a Christmas present,"
  - "or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach.":
      - |
        "Bessie" refers to [Bessie Smith, the 1930s "Empress of the Blues"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpVCqXRlXx4)
  - "I guess being colored doesn’t make me not like":
      - The enjambment at the end of this line joins the common ground---the things we all enjoy---with racially-motivated things which can drive us apart. It transitions between an idealistic truth, and the realistic truth of the time.
  - "the same things other folks like who are other races."
  - "So will my page be colored that I write?":
      - The speaker starts exploring the impact of race on their writing.
      - Will their page---the truth they uncover---be marked by racial experience? Will it 'color' the page? The speaker is unsure.
  - "Being me, it will not be white."
  - "But it will be"
  - "a part of you, instructor.":
      - Everyone learns from writing. In this case, the page becomes a part of the instructor.
      - The speaker has literary power.
  - "You are white—"
  - "yet a part of me, as I am a part of you."
  - "That’s American.":
      - Despite the differences the speaker notes above, they make the firm point that resolving these differences is core to the American experience.
  - "Sometimes perhaps you don’t want to be a part of me."
  - "Nor do I often want to be a part of you."
  - "But we are, that’s true!":
      - The speaker takes an almost optimistic perspective.
      - Through the mutual dislike the speaker portrays, they still note that they have to work *together* with the instructor to get anything done.
  - "As I learn from you,"
  - "I guess you learn from me—":
      - The speaker emphasizes an intellectual give-and-take.
      - They may be a student, but they also have a unique life experience that the instructor simply doesn't.
  - "although you’re older—and white—"
  - "and somewhat more free.":
      - |
        The speaker resolves the optimistic angle of the last few lines with a hard-hitting conclusion: that even though the instructor and the student can work together, learn, and benefit from each other, the student is still disadvantaged in the American system.
      - The phrase "more free" characterizes the speaker's view of American society. Ideally, nobody would be freer than anyone else; but an unpleasant reality disagrees.

- - "This is my page for English B.":
      - The conclusion brings us back to the context. The page exists within the student--teacher dynamic. The teacher posed the original question---and stands to learn a lot more from the answer.
      - It's also a bit of a mic-drop.

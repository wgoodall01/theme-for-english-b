        *Fun fact*: Hughes wasn't actually born in Winston-Salem. This tells us 
        that the poem isn't autobiographical: Hughes and the speaker are two separate people.

  - "I went to school there, then Durham, then here"
  - "to this college on the hill above Harlem."
  - "I am the only colored student in my class."
  - "The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,"
  - "through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,"
  - "Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,"
  - "the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator":
      - The [Harlem Branch Y](https://wikipedia.org) was a place.
  - "up to my room, sit down, and write this page:"

- - "It’s not easy to know what is true for you or me"
  - "at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I’m what"
  - "I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you."
  - "hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page."
  - "(I hear New York, too.) Me—who?"

- - "Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love."
  - "I like to work, read, learn, and understand life."
  - "I like a pipe for a Christmas present,"
  - "or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach."
  - "I guess being colored doesn’t make me not like"
  - "the same things other folks like who are other races."
  - "So will my page be colored that I write?"
  - "Being me, it will not be white."
  - "But it will be"
  - "a part of you, instructor."
  - "You are white—"
  - "yet a part of me, as I am a part of you."
  - "That’s American."
  - "Sometimes perhaps you don’t want to be a part of me."
  - "Nor do I often want to be a part of you."
  - "But we are, that’s true!"
  - "As I learn from you,"
  - "I guess you learn from me—"
  - "although you’re older—and white—"
  - "and somewhat more free."

- - "This is my page for English B."

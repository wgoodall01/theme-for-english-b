# Theme for English B
# Langston Hughes

- - "The instructor said":
      - The poem starts out with an 'instructor:' initially, it's externally motivated.
      - The speaker isn't writing this because they want to themselves; they're writing it because they have to.

        The structure of *Theme for English B* is laid out in three parts: the header, starting here, the page, and a brief, one-line conclusion. This allows Hughes to wrap his assignment in the context of where, when, and by whom it was written.

- kind: stanza
  blockquote: true
  children:
    - "Go home and write"
    - "a page tonight."
    - "And let that page come out of you—"
    - "Then, it will be true.":
        - |
          This line really leaves us with a question: if you write from the heart, will your writing necessarily be true?
        - What does it really take to get to your own emotional truth?
        - These questions set the tone for the rest of the poem, as the speaker tries to get at the truth through their own personal experience.

- - "I wonder if it’s that simple?":
      - In 1951 New York, Hughes's existence as an intellectual force is in and of itself a political statement.
      - The poem starts out by arguing we should realize that things that look simple---
        just 'letting \[the page\] be true'---can turn out to be incredibly challenging when contextualized.

  - "I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.":
      - |
        Langston Hughes wasn't actually born in Winston-Salem (he was born in [Joplin, Missouri](https://www.biography.com/writer/langston-hughes)). This tells us that the poem isn't strictly autobiographical: Hughes and the speaker are two separate people.

  - "I went to school there, then Durham, then here"
  - "to this college on the hill above Harlem.":
      - Most likely, this is referring to City College, literally [located on a hill](https://earth.google.com/web/@40.81680112,-73.94992514,50.82805981a,775.42600941d,35y,-16.61960919h,61.36881103t,0r) above the city. This is, again, another hint that the speaker is not Hughes---as Hughes studied at the nearby Columbia University.

  - "I am the only colored student in my class."
  - "The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,"
  - "through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,"
  - "Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,"
  - "the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator":
      - The Harlem Branch YMCA---originally constructed due to the YMCA's [official policy of racial segregation](https://www.lib.umn.edu/ymca/guide-afam-history) from its founding in 1851 up until 1946---was a major cultural hub in the Harlem Renaissance. The lower floors contained a fitness center, while the upper floors were apartments.
      - Claude McKay, another leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance, lived in the Y. In 1976, it was [officially designated a US National Historic Landmark](https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NHLS/76002143_text) for this reason.
  - "up to my room, sit down, and write this page:":
      - By this point, Hughes has established the setting. The narrator is a student very similar to Hughes. They both live and study in Harlem. They both struggle with finding their own true identity. They both use writing as a tool to help elicit the truth.

- - "It’s not easy to know what is true for you or me":
      - |
        The theme of discovering the truth follows the speaker from their life into their writing.
      - At this point, the speaker is using writing to discover what their truth really is.
  - "at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I’m what"
  - "I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you.":
      - The speaker acknowledges that truth can only extend to the outputs of our senses.
  - "hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page."
  - "(I hear New York, too.) Me—who?"

- - "Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love."
  - "I like to work, read, learn, and understand life."
  - "I like a pipe for a Christmas present,"
  - "or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach."
  - "I guess being colored doesn’t make me not like"
  - "the same things other folks like who are other races."
  - "So will my page be colored that I write?"
  - "Being me, it will not be white."
  - "But it will be"
  - "a part of you, instructor."
  - "You are white—"
  - "yet a part of me, as I am a part of you."
  - "That’s American."
  - "Sometimes perhaps you don’t want to be a part of me."
  - "Nor do I often want to be a part of you."
  - "But we are, that’s true!"
  - "As I learn from you,"
  - "I guess you learn from me—"
  - "although you’re older—and white—"
  - "and somewhat more free."

- - "This is my page for English B."
